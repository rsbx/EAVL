NAME
       EAVL - Embedded AVL tree data structures library


DESCRIPTION
       The  embedded  AVL  tree data structure library is a flexible and effi‐
       cient library defining and  managing  the  relationships  between  data
       structures implementing several distinct AVL tree types.


   Features
       *      EAVL  data  structures  may  be embedded in calling code managed
              data structures.

       *      The contents of the tree nodes is entirely managed by the  call‐
              ing code.

       *      A  rich  set  of functions for manipulating and managing the AVL
              tree.

       *      A complete set of manual pages.

       *      A comprehensive set of granular validation checks  can  be  made
              available at compilation time and enabled/disabled at runtime.


   Tree Types
       "p" (parent)
              This  EAVL tree type is distinguished by not requiring the over‐
              head of an EAVL_cbPathe(7) callback.

       "s" (small)
              This EAVL tree type is distinguished by having the smallest node
              size.

       "c" (copy on write)
              This  EAVL  tree  type is distinguished by the ability to "copy"
              trees with Ο(1) work upfront  and  duplicating  nodes  later  as
              needed.


   Checks
       Validation  checks  are provided to check important aspects of the EAVL
       data structures and as an aid to the calling code programmer to facili‐
       tate proper usage of the EAVL library.

       EAVL_CHECK_CALLBACK
              Checks that callback functions are following the proper protocol
              for the callback type.

       EAVL_CHECK_CONTEXT
              Checks if the calling code and the EAVL  library  are  following
              the context use protocol properly.

       EAVL_CHECK_ORDER
              Checks if the array of node pointers is sorted properly.

       EAVL_CHECK_PARAM
              Checks function parameters.

       EAVL_CHECK_TREE
              Checks   that   tree   is   a   valid  AVL  tree  and  that  the
              EAVL_cbVerify(7) callback, if provided,  does  not  indicate  an
              error.
