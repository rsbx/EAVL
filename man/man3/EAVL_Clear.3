.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR \%EAVLp_Clear "(), " \%EAVLs_Clear "(), and " \%EAVLc_Clear ()
functions empty an \%EAVL tree. An optional
.I \%cbrelease
callback MAY be provided and will be called for each node in an implementation
defined order.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I \%context
Address of an associated context structure.
.TP
.I \%cbrelease
NULL or a pointer to an
.BR \%EAVL_cbRelease (7)
callback function.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
.B \%EAVL_OK
Success.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_CALLBACK
A retryable callback error occurred. The same \%EAVL operation may be attempted
again after the reason for the callback error return is ameliorated.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_CONTEXT
Returned if
.B \%EAVL_CHECK_CONTEXT
checking is available and enabled and
.I \%context
is in an invalid state.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_PARAMETER
Returned if
.IR \%context
is NULL.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_TREE
Returned if
.B \%EAVL_CHECK_TREE
checking is available and enabled and the associated tree does not pass the
tree checks.

.SH CONTEXT STATE
The context MUST associated with an \%EAVL tree when these functions are called.
On function return, context state will match the following table:
.TS
L	C	C
C	C	C
L	|C	C|.
	Operation	Other
Result	Context	Contexts

EAVL_OK	Not set	Not set

.TE
Where
.I n
is the number of nodes in the tree.
.sp
Pathe usage is due to the \%EAVL?_cbPathe() callbacks. For the \%EAVL
pTree tree type, Pathe usage is ÎŸ(0).
