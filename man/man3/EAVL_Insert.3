\%EAVLp_Insert, \%EAVLs_Insert, \%EAVLc_Insert \- add a node to a tree

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR \%EAVLp_Insert "(), " \%EAVLs_Insert "(), and " \%EAVLc_Insert ()
functions insert a new node into the \%EAVL tree associated with
.IR \%context
and stores a pointer to the new node in
.IR \%*resultp .
If a there is already a node in the tree that compares equivalent to the new
node then the new node is not inserted and a pointer to the equivalent node is
stored in
.IR \%*resultp .

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I \%context
Address of an associated and set context structure.
.TP
.I \%new_node
Pointer to a node to insert into the tree associated with
.IR \%context .
.TP
.I \%resultp
Pointer to an \%EAVL node pointer of the appropriate type.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
.B \%EAVL_OK
Success.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_CALLBACK
A retryable callback error occurred. The same \%EAVL operation may be attempted
again after the reason for the callback error return is ameliorated.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_ALIGNMENT
Returned if
.B \%EAVL_CHECK_PARAMETER
checking is available and enabled and the new_node does not meet the alignment
requirements.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_CALLBACK
A non retryable callback error occurred.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_CONTEXT
Returned if the context is not set or if
.B \%EAVL_CHECK_CONTEXT
checking is available and enabled and
.I \%context
is in an invalid state.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_PARAMETER
Returned if
.IR \%context ", " \%new_node ", or " \%resultp
are NULL.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_ERROR_TREE
Returned if
.B \%EAVL_CHECK_TREE
checking is available and enabled and the associated tree does not pass the
tree checks.

.SH CONTEXT STATE
On function return, context state will match the following table:
.TS
L	C	C
C	C	C
L	|C	C|.
	Operation	Other
Result	Context	Contexts
	_	_
EAVL_OK	Set	Not set
EAVL_EXISTS	Set	Unchanged

EAVL_ERROR_PARAMETER	Unchanged	Unchanged
EAVL_ERROR_TREE	Unchanged	Unchanged

.TE
Where
.I n
is the number of nodes in the tree.
.sp
Pathe usage is due to the \%EAVL?_cbPathe() callbacks. For the \%EAVL
pTree tree type, Pathe usage is ÎŸ(0).
