.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR \%EAVLp_cbFixup "(), " \%EAVLs_cbFixup "(), and " \%EAVLc_cbFixup ()
callback functions "fixup" the calling code managed data of a new node or a
node that has potentially had one or both subtrees modified either by an \%EAVL
function call or by fixup callback invocation.
.sp
This callback function type is the counterpart of the
.BR \%EAVL_cbVerify (7)
callback function type.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I \%node
Pointer to the node to fixup.
.TP
.I \%childL
Pointer to the root of the left subtree of
.IR \%node .
.TP
.I \%childR
Pointer to the root of the right subtree of
.IR \%node .
.TP
.I \%cbdata
Value of the
.I \%cbdata
parameter to one of the
.BR \%EAVL_Context_Init (3)
functions.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
.B \%EAVL_CB_OK
Success.
.TP
.B \%EAVL_CB_FINISHED
Success and further fixup callback invocations are unnecessary as part of the
current \%EAVL function call.
